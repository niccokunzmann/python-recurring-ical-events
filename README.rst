ICal has some complexity to it:
Events, TODOs and Journal entries can be repeated, removed from the feed and edited later on.
This tool takes care of these circumstances.

Let's put our expertise together and build a tool that can solve this!

Usage
-----

The `icalendar <https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/>`_ module is responsible for parsing and converting calendars.
The `recurring_ical_events <https://pypi.org/project/recurring-ical-events/>`_ module uses such a `calendar`_ and creates all repetitions of its events within a time span.

To import this module, write

.. code:: Python

    >>> import recurring_ical_events

There are several methods you can use to unfold repeating events, such as ``at(a_time)`` and ``between(a_start, an_end)``.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import icalendar
    >>> import recurring_ical_events
    >>> from pathlib import Path

    # read the calendar file and parse it
    # CALENDARS = Path("to/your/calendar/directory")
    >>> calendar_file : Path = CALENDARS / "fablab_cottbus.ics"
    >>> ical_string = calendar_file.read_bytes()
    >>> print(ical_string[:28])
    BEGIN:VCALENDAR
    VERSION:2.0
    >>> a_calendar = icalendar.Calendar.from_ical(ical_string)

    # request the events in a specific interval
    # start on the 1st of January 2017 0:00
    >>> start_date = (2017, 1, 1)

    # the event on the 1st of January 2018 is not included
    >>> end_date =   (2018,  1, 1)
    >>> events = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar).between(start_date, end_date)
    >>> for event in events:
    ...     start = event["DTSTART"].dt
    ...     summary = event["SUMMARY"]
    ...     print(f"start {start} summary {summary}")
    start 2017-03-11 17:00:00+01:00 summary Vereinssitzung

``at(a_date)``
**************

You can get all events which take place at ``a_date``.
A date can be a year, e.g. ``2023``, a month of a year e.g. January in 2023 ``(2023, 1)``, a day of a certain month e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1)``, an hour e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1, 0)``, a minute e.g. ``(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0)``, or second as well as a `datetime.date <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date>`_ object and `datetime.datetime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime>`_.

The start and end are inclusive. As an example: if an event is longer than one day it is still included if it takes place at ``a_date``.

.. code:: Python

    >>> import datetime

    # save the query object for the calendar
    >>> query = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar)
    >>> len(query.at(2023))                      # a year - 2023 has 12 events happening
    12
    >>> len(query.at((2023,)))                   # a year
    12
    >>> len(query.at((2023, 1)))                 # January in 2023 - only one event is in January
    1
    >>> len(query.at((2023, 1, 1)))              # the 1st of January in 2023
    0
    >>> len(query.at("20230101"))                # the 1st of January in 2023
    0
    >>> len(query.at((2023, 1, 1, 0)))           # the first hour of the year 2023
    0
    >>> len(query.at((2023, 1, 1, 0, 0)))        # the first minute in 2023
    0
    >>> len(query.at(datetime.date(2023, 1, 1))) # the first day in 2023
    0
    >>> len(query.at(datetime.date.today()))     # today
    0
    >>> len(query.at(datetime.datetime.now()))   # this exact second
    0

The resulting ``events`` are a list of `icalendar events <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Event>`_, see below.

``between(start, end)``
***********************

``between(start, end)`` returns all events happening between a start and an end time. Both arguments can be `datetime.datetime`_, `datetime.date`_, tuples of numbers passed as arguments to `datetime.datetime`_ or strings in the form of
``%Y%m%d`` (``yyyymmdd``) and ``%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`` (``yyyymmddThhmmssZ``).
Additionally, the ``end`` argument can be a ``datetime.timedelta`` to express that the end is relative to the ``start``.
For examples of arguments, see ``at(a_date)`` above.

.. code:: Python

    >>> query = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar)

    # What happens in 2016, 2017 and 2018?
    >>> events = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar).between(2016, 2019)
    >>> len(events) # quite a lot is happening!
    39

The resulting ``events`` are in a list of `icalendar events`_, see below.

``after(earliest_end)``
***********************

You can retrieve events that happen after a time or date using ``after(earliest_end)``.
Events that are happening during the ``earliest_end`` are included in the iteration.

.. code:: Python

    >>> earlierst_end = 2023
    >>> for i, event in enumerate(query.after(earlierst_end)):
    ...     print(f"{event['SUMMARY']} ends {event['DTEND'].dt}") # all dates printed are after January 1st 2023
    ...     if i > 10: break  # we might get endless events and a lot of them!

    Repair Café ends 2023-02-04 17:00:00+01:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-03-04 17:00:00+01:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-04-01 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-05-06 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-06-03 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-07-01 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-08-05 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-09-02 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-10-07 17:00:00+02:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-11-04 17:00:00+01:00
    Repair Café ends 2023-12-02 17:00:00+01:00


``all()``
*********

If you wish to iterate over all occurrences of the components, then you can use ``all()``.
Since a calendar can define a huge amount of recurring entries, this method generates them
and forgets them, reducing memory overhead.

This example shows the first event that takes place in the calendar:

.. code:: Python

    >>> first_event = next(query.all()) # not all events are generated
    >>> print(f"The first event is {first_event['SUMMARY']}")
    The first event is Weihnachts Repair-Café

``count()``
***********

You can count occurrences of events and other components using ``count()``.

.. code:: Python

    >>> number_of_TODOs = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar, components=["VTODO"]).count()
    >>> print(f"You have {number_of_TODOs} things to do!")
    You have 0 things to do!

    >>> number_of_journal_entries = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar, components=["VJOURNAL"]).count()
    >>> print(f"There are {number_of_journal_entries} journal entries in the calendar.")
    There are 0 journal entries in the calendar.

However, this can be very costly!


``events`` as list - ``at()`` and ``between()``
***********************************************

The result of both ``between(start, end)`` and ``at(a_date)`` is a list of `icalendar events`_.
By default, all attributes of the event with repetitions are copied, like ``UID`` and ``SUMMARY``.
However, these attributes may differ from the source event:

* ``DTSTART`` which is the start of the event instance. (always present)
* ``DTEND`` which is the end of the event instance. (always present)
* ``RDATE``, ``EXDATE``, ``RRULE`` are the rules to create event repetitions.
  They are **not** included in repeated events, see `Issue 23 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/23>`_.
  To change this, use ``of(calendar, keep_recurrence_attributes=True)``.

Generator - ``after()`` and ``all()``
*************************************

If the resulting components are ordered when ``after(earliest_end)`` or ``all()`` is used.
The result is an iterator that returns the events in order.

.. code:: Python

    for event in recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).after(datetime.datetime.now()):
        print(event["DTSTART"]) # The start is ordered

Different Components, not just Events
*************************************

By default the ``recurring_ical_events`` only selects events as the name already implies.
However, there are different `components <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Component>`_ available in a `calendar <https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Calendar>`_.
You can select which components you like to have returned by passing ``components`` to the ``of`` function:

.. code:: Python

    of(a_calendar, components=["VEVENT"])

Here is a template code for choosing the supported types of components:

.. code:: Python

   >>> query_events = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar)
   >>> query_journals = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar, components=["VJOURNAL"])
   >>> query_todos = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar, components=["VTODO"])
   >>> query_all = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar, components=["VTODO", "VEVENT", "VJOURNAL"])

If a type of component is not listed here, it can be added.
Please create an issue for this in the source code repository.

You can create subclasses and customizations.



Speed
*****

If you use ``between()`` or ``at()``
several times, it is faster to re-use the object coming from ``of()``.

.. code:: Python

    >>> query = recurring_ical_events.of(a_calendar)
    >>> events_of_day_1 = query.at((2019, 2, 1))
    >>> events_of_day_2 = query.at((2019, 2, 2))
    >>> events_of_day_3 = query.at((2019, 2, 3))

    # ... and so on

Skip bad formatted ical events
******************************

Some events may be badly formatted and therefore cannot be handled by ``recurring-ical-events``.
Passing ``skip_bad_series=True`` as ``of()`` argument will totally skip theses events.

.. code:: Python

    >>> calendar_file = CALENDARS / "bad_rrule_missing_until_event.ics"
    >>> calendar_with_bad_event = icalendar.Calendar.from_ical(calendar_file.read_bytes())

     # default: error
    >>> recurring_ical_events.of(calendar_with_bad_event, skip_bad_series=False).count()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    recurring_ical_events.BadRuleStringFormat: UNTIL parameter is missing: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH;WKST=SU;UNTL=20191023

    # skip the bad events
    >>> recurring_ical_events.of(calendar_with_bad_event, skip_bad_series=True).count()
    0


Version Fixing
**************

If you use this library in your code, you may want to make sure that
updates can be received but they do not break your code.
The version numbers are handeled this way: ``a.b.c`` example: ``0.1.12``

- ``c`` is changed for each minor bug fix.
- ``b`` is changed whenever new features are added.
- ``a`` is changed when the interface or major assumptions change that may break your code.

So, I recommend to version-fix this library to stay with the same ``a``
while ``b`` and ``c`` can change.

Development
-----------

Code style
**********

Please install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ before git commit.  It will ensure that the code is formatted and linted as expected using `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_.

.. code-block:: shell

   pre-commit install


Testing
*******

This project's development is driven by tests.
Tests assure a consistent interface and less knowledge lost over time.
If you like to change the code, tests help that nothing breaks in the future.
They are required in that sense.
Example code and ics files can be transferred into tests and speed up fixing bugs.

You can view the tests in the `test folder
<https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/tree/master/test>`_.
If you have a calendar ICS file for which this library does not
generate the desired output, you can add it to the ``test/calendars``
folder and write tests for what you expect.
If you like, `open an issue <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues>`_ first, e.g. to discuss the changes and
how to go about it.


To run the tests, we use ``tox``.
``tox`` tests all different Python versions which we want to  be compatible to.

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install tox

To run all the tests:

.. code-block:: shell

   tox

To run the tests in a specific Python version:

.. code-block:: shell

   tox -e py39



New Releases
------------

To release new versions,

1. edit the Changelog Section
2. edit setup.py, the ``__version__`` variable
3. create a commit and push it
4. wait for `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/actions>`_ to finish the build
5. run

   .. code-block:: shell

       python3 setup.py tag_and_deploy

6. notify the issues about their release

Architecture
------------

.. image:: img/architecture.png
   :alt: Architecture Diagram showing the components interacting

Each icalendar **Calendar** can contain Events, Journal entries,
TODOs and others, called **Components**.
Those entries are grouped by their ``UID``.
Such a ``UID`` defines a **Series** of **Occurrences** that take place at
a given time.
Since each **Component** is different, the **ComponentAdapter** offers a unified
interface to interact with them.
The **Calendar** gets filtered and for each ``UID``,
a **Series** can use one or more **ComponentAdapters** to create 
**Occurrences** of what happens in a time span.
These **Occurrences** are used internally and convert to **Components** for further use.

  - Fix issue with repetitions over DST boundary. See `Issue 48 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/48>`_.

- v0.1.20b

  - Fix handling of modified recurrences with lower sequence number than their base event `Pull Request 45 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/45>`_

- v0.1.19b

  - Benchmark using `@mrx23dot <https://github.com/mrx23dot>`_'s script and speed up recurrence calculation by factor 4, see `Issue 42 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/42>`_.

- v0.1.18b

  - Handle `Issue 28 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/28>`__ so that EXDATEs match as expected.
  - Handle `Issue 27 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/27>`_ so that parsing some rrule UNTIL values does not crash.

- v0.1.17b

  - Handle `Issue 28 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/28>`__ where passed arguments lead to errors where it is expected to work.

- v0.1.16b

  - Events with an empty RRULE are handled like events without an RRULE.
  - Remove fixed dependency versions, see `Issue 14 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/14>`_

- v0.1.15b

  - Repeated events also include subcomponents. `Issue 6 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/6>`_

- v0.1.14b

  - Fix compatibility `issue 20 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/20>`_: EXDATEs of different time zones are now supported.

- v0.1.13b

  - Remove attributes RDATE, EXDATE, RRULE from repeated events `Issue 23`_
  - Use vDDDTypes instead of explicit date/datetime type `Pull Request 19 <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/pull/19>`_

Libraries Used
--------------

- `python-dateutil <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/>`_ - to compute the recurrences of events using ``rrule``
- `icalendar`_ - the library used to parse ICS files
- `pytz <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_ - for timezones
- `x-wr-timezone <https://github.com/niccokunzmann/x-wr-timezone>`_ for handling the non-standard ``X-WR-TIMEZONE`` property.
