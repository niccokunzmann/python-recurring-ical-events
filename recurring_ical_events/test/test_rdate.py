Property Name:  RDATE

   Purpose:  This property defines the list of DATE-TIME values for
      recurring events, to-dos, journal entries, or time zone
      definitions.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type, and time
      zone identifier property parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component.

   Description:  This property can appear along with the "RRULE"
      property to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences.
      When they both appear in a recurring component, the recurrence
      instances are defined by the union of occurrences defined by both
      the "RDATE" and "RRULE".

      The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
      recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
      with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
      value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
      and "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME
      values specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start
      DATE-TIME values specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence
      over those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and
      "RRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
      and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
      Duplicate instances are ignored.
