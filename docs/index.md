Query [ICS calendars](https://icalendar.readthedocs.io) for occurrences of events, todos, journal entries and alarms.

ICal has some complexity to it:
Events, TODOs, Journal entries and Alarms can be repeated, removed from the feed and edited later on.
This tool takes care of these complexities.

Let's put our expertise together and build the solution solves ICalendar scheduling for Python!
